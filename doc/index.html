  <h2>OpenTheory</h2>

  The <a href="goal.html">goal</a> of the OpenTheory project is to
  allow proofs to be shared between the different theorem prover
  implementations of higher order logic, including <a
  href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a>, <a
  href="http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/index.html">ProofPower/HOL</a>
  and <a
  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/index.html">hol-light</a>.
  As a consequence, it is hoped that a standard library of formalized
  mathematics can be built up for higher order logic.

  <h3>Project Status</h3>

  The OpenTheory project has published a <a href="article.html">file
  format standard</a> for <em>articles</em> containing statements and
  proofs of theorems. Articles are not supposed to be self-contained,
  and may require types, constants and theorems that must be supplied
  by the theorem proving system reading the article. There is also a
  set of <a href="examples.html">example articles</a> which can be
  used to test tools implementing the article standard.

  <p>

  There is active development on tool support for the project. Higher
  order logic theorem provers involved in the OpenTheory project have
  to be instrumented to read and write article files. In addition,
  stand-alone tools are envisaged to normalize articles to use a
  minimal set of primitive inference rules, eliminate redundancy,
  create an article signature of required and provided theorems, and
  join together articles.

  <h3>Project Members</h3>
