<h2>OpenTheory</h2>

<p>The

<a href="goal.html">goal</a>

of the OpenTheory project is to allow proofs to be shared between the
different theorem prover implementations of higher order logic,
including

<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a>,

<a href="http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/index.html">ProofPower/HOL</a>

and

<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/index.html">hol-light</a>.

As a consequence, it is hoped that a standard library of formalized
mathematics can be built up for higher order logic.</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>

<p>The OpenTheory project has published a

<a href="article.html">file format standard</a>

for <em>articles</em> containing statements and proofs of theorems.
Articles are not supposed to be self-contained, and may require types,
constants and theorems that must be supplied by the theorem proving
system reading the article. There is also a set
of

<a href="examples.html">example articles</a>

which can be used to test tools implementing the article standard.</p>

<p>There is active development on tool support for the project. Higher
order logic theorem provers involved in the OpenTheory project have to
be instrumented to read and write article files. In addition,
stand-alone tools are envisaged to normalize articles to use a minimal
set of primitive inference rules, eliminate redundancy, create an
article signature of required and provided theorems, and join together
articles.</p>
