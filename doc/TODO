Add hd_tl as an inverse of cons

Declare foreign constants to be of type alpha, and specialize as much
as possible when computing REQUIRES section of signature.

Add two more parameters to the interpretation function. An object ->
object map to conserve memory, and a theorem dump to save time.

IDEAS

Integrate automatic tools into behold, such as a ported (and cleaned
up?) version of metis. Also an intelligent simplifier: the kind of
thing that might polish off ecc goals.

If we have a theorem [h] |- c and another theorem [a] |- b where
h\sigma = b, then we automagically generate the theorem [a\sigma] |-
c\sigma. Hopefully this won't blow things up unduly, and it means we
can read in theories in any order. Plainly we need a (higher order?
higher order patterns?) discrimination net for conclusions of
theorems.

The opentheory program is a general tool for concatenating theories.
