Get rid of simulation stacks and Osequents

save takes one theorem and saves it

Add hd_tl as an inverse of cons

FEATURES

Declare foreign constants to be of type alpha, and specialize as much
as possible when computing REQUIRES section of signature.




Add two more parameters to the interpretation function. An object ->
object map to conserve memory, and a theorem dump to save time.

When referring to a theorem in a previous theory (or a locale
assumption), then retrieve theorem if possible, or call ASSUME if
necessary. When creating the signature of a theory, the REQUIRES
section is all the assumptions of all the theorems (plus any types,
constants or locale variables mentioned in them).

IDEAS

Integrate automatic tools into behold, such as a ported (and cleaned
up?) version of metis. Also an intelligent simplifier: the kind of
thing that might polish off ecc goals.

If we have a theorem [h] |- c and another theorem [a] |- b where
h\sigma = b, then we automagically generate the theorem [a\sigma] |-
c\sigma. Hopefully this won't blow things up unduly, and it means we
can read in theories in any order. Plainly we need a (higher order?
higher order patterns?) discrimination net for conclusions of
theorems.
