  <h2>OpenTheory Project Goals</h2>

  The goal of the OpenTheory project is to allow proofs to be shared
  between the different theorem prover implementations of higher order
  logic, including <a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a>, <a
  href="http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/index.html">ProofPower/HOL</a>
  and <a
  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/index.html">hol-light</a>
  <a href="#footnote-isabelle">[1]</a>.

  <p>

  The primary benefits of the OpenTheory project are as follows:

  <ul>

   <li>users can exchange theories of formalized mathematics, so that
   the same theorems do not have to be laboriously formalized in
   multiple systems;</li>

   <li>users can make their formalizations independent of a particular
   set of tactics, so that the proofs don't break when the system is
   upgraded; and</li>

   <li>developers can examine the proofs output by the tactics in
   their system (for example, to check theorems proved by the linear
   arithmetic decision procedure in another system can be proved by
   the corresponding decision procedure in their own system).</li>

  </ul>

  It is hoped that the OpenTheory format is adopted by the higher
  order logic theorem proving community, and that a standard library
  of formalized mathematics can be built up for higher order logic. In
  the spirit of the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/qed/">QED
  Project</a>, the motivation for this combines the aesthetic pleasure
  of elegant formalization with the practical use of a mathematical
  library in verification. In addition, it can be viewed as
  engineering support for intensive formalized mathematics efforts
  such as the <a
  href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/~thales/flyspeck/">FlySpeck</a>
  project.

  <h3>Notes</h3>

  <a name="footnote-isabelle">[1]</a> Isabelle/HOL would also be
  desirable, but more difficult because "Isabelle offers a slightly
  extended type system with type classes (like group and ring)."
